# Database

- [ ] Use encryption for data identifying users and sensitive data like access tokens, email addresses or billing details.
- [ ] If your database supports low cost encryption at rest (like AWS Aurora), then enable that to secure data on disk. Make sure all backups are stored encrypted as well.
- [ ] Use minimal privilege for the database access user account. Don’t use the database root account.
- [ ] Store and distribute secrets using a key store designed for the purpose. Don’t hard code in your applications.
- [ ] Fully prevent SQL injection by only using SQL prepared statements. For example: if using NPM, don’t use npm-mysql, use npm-mysql2 which supports prepared statements.

# Development

- [ ] Ensure that all components of your software are scanned for vulnerabilities for every version pushed to production. This means O/S, libraries and packages. This should be automated into the CI-CD process.
- [ ] Secure development systems with equal vigilance to what you use for production systems. Build the software from secured, isolated development systems.


# Authentication

- [ ] Ensure all passwords are hashed using appropriate crypto such as bcrypt. Never write your own crypto and correctly initialize crypto with good random data.
- [ ] Implement simple but adequate password rules that encourage users to have long, random passwords.
- [ ] Use multi-factor authentication for your logins to all your service providers.

# Denial of Service Protection

- [ ] Make sure that DOS attacks on your APIs won’t cripple your site. At a minimum, have rate limiters on your slower API paths like login and token generation routines.
- [ ] Enforce sanity limits on the size and structure of user submitted data and requests.
- [ ] Use Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) mitigation via a global caching proxy service like CloudFlare. This can be turned on if you suffer a DDOS attack and otherwise function as your DNS lookup.

# Web Traffic

- [ ] Use TLS for the entire site, not just login forms and responses. Never use TLS for just the login form.
- [ ] Cookies must be httpOnly and secure and be scoped by path and domain.
- [ ] Use CSP without allowing unsafe-* backdoors. It is a pain to configure, but worthwhile.
- [ ] Use X-Frame-Option, X-XSS-Protection headers in client responses
- [ ] Use HSTS responses to force TLS only access. Redirect all HTTP request to HTTPS on the server as backup.
- [ ] Use CSRF tokens in all forms and use the new SameSite Cookie response header which fixes CSRF once and for all newer browsers.

# APIs

- [ ] Ensure that no resources are enumerable in your public APIs.
- [ ] Ensure that users are fully authenticated and authorized appropriately when using your APIs.

# Validation

- [ ] Do client-side input validation for quick user feedback, but never trust it.
- [ ] Validate every last bit of user input using white lists on the server. Never directly inject user content into responses. Never use user input in SQL statements.

# Cloud Configuration

- [ ] Ensure all services have minimum ports open. While security through obscurity is no protection, using non-standard ports will make it a little bit harder for attackers.
- [ ] Host backend database and services on private VPCs that are not visible on any public network. Be very careful when configuring AWS security groups and peering VPCs which can inadvertently make services visible to the public.
- [ ] Isolate logical services in separate VPCs and peer VPCs to provide inter-service communication.
- [ ] Ensure all services only accept data from a minimal set of IP addresses.
- [ ] Restrict outgoing IP and port traffic to minimize APTs and “botification”.
- [ ] Always use AWS IAM roles and not root credentials.
- [ ] Use minimal access privilege for all ops and developer staff
- [ ] Regularly rotate passwords and access keys according to a schedule.
